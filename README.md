Custom Language Interpreter

Introduction

This project is a Custom Language Interpreter written in Python, designed to interpret a simple custom language. The custom language includes features such as variable declaration (dec), printing values (show()), and control flow statements including if, elif, else, and while.

Features

Variable Declaration (dec): Allows users to declare variables in the custom language.
Printing Values (show()): Acts as the print function in Python, displaying values on the output display.
Control Flow Statements: Supports if, elif, else, and while statements for conditional and looping constructs.

Usage

Text Editor Interface: The program provides a Text Editor interface built using the Tkinter library. Upon starting the interpreter, the Text Editor opens, allowing users to write code in the custom language.
Writing Code: Users can write their code in the Text Editor, utilizing features such as variable declaration, printing values, and control flow statements.
Executing Code: After writing the code, users can execute it by pressing the Execute button.
Output Display: The results of the executed code will be shown in the output display section of the interface.
